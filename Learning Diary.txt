I set up the repository for the course and looked into the module tasklist. I checked the first part of the video but since this is not my first time doing HTML I didnt really learn anything new.

I continued with the exercise material. I created a homepage HTML markup and wrote also some css. The most important thing I learnt was to write HTML more effectively on vscode: for example writing "div.container" creates a div tag that has a class named "container".
I'm sure that shortcut will help me a lot later on. I also understood how adding fonts to your website works.

I decided to start working on my own project alongside the exercise project so I created a separate directory for that. I'm pretty sure I will make it a CV / portfolio for myself, I can't really come up with any other ideas. 
I continued learning about CSS and there was many new things I didn't know beforehand. Personally I felt like learning about variables was the most important one because having to copy and paste hex codes is something I have found very annoying before. 
Nesting was not a completely new thing to me but now I definitely understand the way it works better.
